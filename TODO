- static layer support both in brac and bric level
- please add a feature in the Brac panel to allow us to Save As Template. There should be a checkbox to make that template the default template
- a python script that can run on a server and update brac files, then upload the new content to a Dropbox folder, using the Dropbox API.
- options for automatic removal of white spaces
- it would be nice to see a tool that could be given a URL with search terms and automatically create a Brac project by selecting the results of the search and using them to populate the same structure as found in the template file.
done - two options for area selecction, rectangular and lasso
done - we need the ability to draw non-rectangular cut shapes in the chrome extension
done - please increase the timeout value in the bric-sync tool to 60 seconds instead of 2
done - add a New button to the Brac panel that creates a new brac project by loading the default template.

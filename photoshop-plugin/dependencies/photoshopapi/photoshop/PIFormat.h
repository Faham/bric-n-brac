* The file type for format modules for Mac OS is 8BIF, the extension for Windows is .8BI.  \n\n

/**
* Allows the plug-in module to begin its interaction with the host.
* If the plug-in supports scripting, it should read any scripting parameters to override 
* any default parameters. The scripting system also returns whether to show the 
* plug-in dialog or not.\n\n
* The plug-in should initialize \c FormatRecord::imageMode, \c FormatRecord::imageSize32, 
* \c FormatRecord::depth, \c FormatRecord::planes, \c FormatRecord::imageHRes and 
* \c FormatRecord::imageVRes. \n\n
* If an indexed color image is being opened, the plug-in should also set \c FormatRecord::redLUT, 
* \c FormatRecord::greenLUT and \c FormatRecord::blueLUT. \n\n
* If the plug-in has a block of image resources to process, it should read the image resources
* in from the file and set \c FormatRecord::imageRsrcData to be a handle to the resource data. 
* For more information about Photoshop image resources, see 
* <a href="../Photoshop File Formats.pdf">Photoshop File Formats</a>.	\n\n
* The plug-in should allocate and read the first pixel image data buffer as appropriate. 
* The area of the image being returned to the plug-in host is specified by \c FormatRecord::theRect32, 
* \c FormatRecord::loPlane, and \c FormatRecord::hiPlane.\n\n
* The actual pixel data is pointed by \c  FormatRecord::data. The \c FormatRecord::colBytes, 
* \c FormatRecord::rowBytes, \c FormatRecord::planeBytes, and \c FormatRecord::planeMap 
* fields must specify the organization of the data.\n\n
* Photoshop is very flexible about the format in which image data can be read. 
* For example, to read just the red plane of an RGB color image, use the following parameter values:
* 	<TABLE border="1"
* 	     summary="Read red plane of RGB.">
* 	<CAPTION><EM>Read red plane of RGB</EM></CAPTION>
* 	<TR><TH>Parameter<TH>Value
* 	<TR><TH>loPlane<TD>0
* 	<TR><TH>hiPlane<TD>0
* 	<TR><TH>colBytes<TD>1
* 	<TR><TH>rowBytes<TD>width of the area being read
* 	<TR><TH>planeBytes<TD>ignored, since loPlane=hiPlane
* 	</TABLE> \n\n
* If you wish to read the RGB data in interleaved form (RGBRGB...), use the following values:
* 	<TABLE border="1"
* 	     summary="Read RGB values in interleaved form.">
* 	<CAPTION><EM>Read RGB values in interleaved form</EM></CAPTION>
* 	<TR><TH>Parameter<TH>Value
* 	<TR><TH>loPlane<TD>0
* 	<TR><TH>hiPlane<TD>2
* 	<TR><TH>colBytes<TD>3

/** @defgroup ImportModule Import Modules
* Import plug-in modules are used to capture images from add-on hardware, such as scanners
* or video cameras, and put these images into new Photoshop document windows.
* Import modules can also be used to read images from unsupported file formats, although file
* format modules often are better suited for this purpose. File format modules are accessed 
* directly from the @b Open command, while Import modules use the @b Import sub-menu.  
*
* Prior to Photoshop version 4.0 these modules were called Acquire modules. Most of the
* internal nomenclature and function calls reflect the old naming conventions, to stay compatible 
* with previous versions.   
*
* The file type for format modules for Mac OS is 8BAM, the extension for Windows is .8BA.
* 
* Please also see @ref PGImportModule "Writing Import Plug-ins"
*/

/** @defgroup StackRendererModule Stack Renderer Modules
* Stack Renderer plug-in modules are used to render a stack of images (defined as a smart object)
* into a single image. A typical application includes stacking multiple low exposure images and 
* rendering into a single clearer image. Stack Renderer plug-in modules are built on top of Import 
* (Acquire) modules. This means that you define the plug-in through the PiPL resource as an Import 
* module <tt> (Kind {Acquire});  </tt> but then additionally include the <tt> StackRenderer </tt> 
* PiPL property to identify the plug-in to Photoshop as a Stack Renderer plug-in.
*
* Hence, Stack Renderer plug-ins share all data stuctures and selectors with @ref ImportModule
* "Import Modules". The relevant data structures and selectors include:  <br>
* - AcquireRecord, 
* - @ref acquireSelectorAbout,  
* - @ref acquireSelectorPrepare,
* - @ref acquireSelectorStart,
* - @ref acquireSelectorContinue, and
* - @ref acquireSelectorFinish.
*
* In particular, see the new field \c AcquireRecord::documentInfo, in which Photoshop provides the 
* plug-in with access to the image stack information.
*
* Please also see @ref PGStackRendererModule "Writing Stack Renderer Plug-ins"

* During this call, the plug-in module should set \c AcquireRecord::imageMode, 
* \c AcquireRecord::imageSize

* \c AcquireRecord::depth, \c AcquireRecord::planes, \c AcquireRecord::imageHRes and

* If a duotone mode image is being returned, 
* you should also set \c AcquireRecord::duotoneInfo.  \n\n
* The plug-in host can loop back to \c acquireSelectorStart after completing \c acquireSelectorFinish
* to begin importing another image for multi-image importing.  See @ref PGMultipleImport 
* "Multiple Import" for	more information. 
*/
#define acquireSelectorStart	1

/**
* Returns an area of the image to the plug-in host. Photoshop continues 
* to call this routine until it either returns an error, or the plug-in module sets the 
* \c AcquireRecord::data field to NULL.  For a discussion of using \c AdvanceStateProc
* in the handler for this selector, see 
* @ref PGImportAdvanceState "Advance State and Import Modules."\n\n
* The area of the image the plug-in returns is specified by \c AcquireRecord::theRect or 
* \c AcquireRecord::theRect32, \c AcquireRecord::loPlane and \c AcquireRecord::hiPlane.
* If the 
* resolution of the imported image is always going to be very small (for example, NTSC frame 
* grabbers), the plug-in can simply set \c theRect or \c theRect32 to the 
* entire image area. However, 
* if you are working with large images, the plug-in must use the \c theRect or \c theRect32 field to 
* return the image in several pieces.  \n\n
* There are no restrictions on how the pieces tile the image; horizontal and vertical strips 
* are allowed as are a grid of tiles. Each piece should contain no more than \c AcquireRecord::maxData 
* bytes, less the size of any large tables or scratch areas allocated by the plug-in.
* These restrictions don’t apply if the buffer for the image data was allocated using the 
* Buffer or Handle suites.	\n\n
* The \c AcquireRecord::data field should point to the actual data being returned. The fields 
* \c AcquireRecord::colBytes, \c AcquireRecord::rowBytes 
* and \c AcquireRecord::planeBytes specify the organization of the data.\n\n
* The \c data field contains a pointer to the data being returned. The plug-in can allocate a buffer 
* for the data using:
* - the Mac OS \c NewPtr trap,
* - the Windows \c GlobalAlloc function, or
* - through the @ref PicaBufferSuite.
*
* The plug-in module is responsible for freeing this buffer in its @ref acquireSelectorFinish 
* handler.	\n\n
* @note Be careful processing user-cancel events during \c acquireSelectorContinue. Normally your 
* plug-in would be expecting another \c acquireSelectorContinue call. If the user cancels, the next 
* call is @ref acquireSelectorFinish, not \c acquireSelectorContinue!	
* 
* Photoshop is very flexible in the format in which image data can be returned. 
* 
* For example, to return just the red plane of an RGB color image, 
* use the following parameter values:
* 	<TABLE border="1"
* 	     summary="Return red plane of RGB.">
* 	<CAPTION><EM>Return red plane of RGB</EM></CAPTION>
* 	<TR><TH>Parameter<TH>Value
* 	<TR><TH>loPlane<TD>0
* 	<TR><TH>hiPlane<TD>0
* 	<TR><TH>colBytes<TD>1
* 	<TR><TH>rowBytes<TD>width of the area being returned
* 	<TR><TH>planeBytes<TD>ignored, since loPlane=hiPlane
* 	</TABLE> \n\n
* If you wish to return the RGB data in interleaved form (RGBRGB...), 
* use the following values:.
* Return RGB data in interleaved form
* 	<TABLE border="1"
* 	     summary="Return RGB values in interleaved form.">
* 	<CAPTION><EM>Return RGB values in interleaved form</EM></CAPTION>
* 	<TR><TH>Parameter<TH>Value
* 	<TR><TH>loPlane<TD>0
* 	<TR><TH>hiPlane<TD>2
* 	<TR><TH>colBytes<TD>3
* 	<TR><TH>rowBytes<TD>3 * width of the area being returned
* 	<TR><TH>planeBytes<TD>1
* 	</TABLE> 
*/

/**
* Allows the plug-in to clean up after an image import. This call is made if and 
* only if the @ref acquireSelectorStart routine returns without error, even if the 
* @ref acquireSelectorContinue routine returns an error.
* Most plug-ins at least need to free the buffer used to return the image data.
* If Photoshop detects \e Command-period in the Mac OS or \e Escape in Windows while processing the 
* results of an \c acquireSelectorContinue call, it calls \c acquireSelectorFinish.	 \n\n
* For scripting issues related to \c acquireSelectorFinish, see 
* @ref PGImportScriptingFinish "Scripting at importSelectorFinish" \n\n
* The plug-in host can loop back to \c acquireSelectorStart after completing \c acquireSelectorFinish
* to begin importing another image for multi-image importing.  See @ref PGMultipleImport 
* "Multiple Import" for	more information. 
* @note If @ref acquireSelectorStart succeeds,

* \c AcquireRecord::wantFinalize) then the host makes this call after all possible looping is complete. 
* \n\n
* If your plug-in is scripting-aware and the plug-in has changed any initial parameters, 
* it should pass a complete descriptor back to the scripting system in the 
* @ref PIDescriptorParameters structure.

/** @defgroup ExportModule Export Module
* Export plug-in modules are used to output an image from an open Photoshop document.  
* Export modules can be used to print to printers that do not have Mac OS 
* Chooser-level driver support.	\n\n
* They can also be used to save images in unsupported or compressed file formats, 
* although File Format modules often are better suited for this purpose. File Format 
* modules are accessed directly from the \b Save and \b Save \b As commands, whereas 
* Export modules use the \b Export sub-menu. <br><br>
* The file type for export modules for Mac OS is 8BEM, the extension for Windows is .8BE.  \n\n
* Please also see @ref PGExportModule "Writing Export Plug-ins".
